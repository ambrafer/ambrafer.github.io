## Scientific background
I have always been fascinated by **how our brain merges information from our complex multisensory world, and how (a)typical development shapes this crucial ability**. During my Master’s thesis at CIMeC, University of Trento (IT), I worked with Prof. Olivier Collignon on cross-modal plasticity in deafness using MRI. My work showed intact functional specialization for spatial and motion processing in the deaf auditory cortex, despite input from a different sensory modality (i.e. vision). This research experience consolidated my desire to understand how the brain implements cognition across the senses.

In 2020 I completed a PhD in computational neuroscience with Prof. Uta Noppeney at the University of Birmingham (UK). There, I studied multimodal integration through the framework of Bayesian Causal Inference, which represents the **state-of-the-art principled computational account of how the brain binds information across the senses**. Of note, my work (combining psychophysics, computational modelling and MRI) also investigated the **multisensory processing of naturalistic stimuli** (i.e. music), offering original insights into how the brain automatically tracks naturalistic multisensory information.

Having approached perception from a Bayesian perspective, I started wondering about how prior expectations are established and how they evolve as a function of learning. Driven by this interest, I worked as a postdoc in the Predictive Bain lab of Prof. Floris de Lange at the Donders Institute (NL), where I combined behavioural analyses and fMRI to examine **how expectations are implemented in the brain**. My work bridging the gap between statistical learning and predictive processing encountered significant interest in the scientific community during a national symposium that I co-organized.

Next, I brought my expertise in multimodal integration and prediction to the realm of face-to-face communication, working as a postdoc in the Neurobiology of Language Department of Prof. Peter Hagoort at the Max Plank Institute for Psycholinguistics (NL). Using advanced Bayesian modelling, I resolved the outstanding debate on how language comprehension is influenced by beat gestures, i.e. rhythmic up-and-down hand movements that typically accompany prosodic stress in natural, face-to-face conversation. In parallel, I started formalizing my ideas about **how multimodal face-to-face communication is implemented in the brain**, which received positive feedback during an international symposium that I co-organized.

Recently, I decided to venture into developmental neuroscience to directly tackle the question of **how we learn to use verbal and non-verbal communication to exchange meanings with other individuals**. Specifically, I got interested in examining whether and how preverbal infants use manual gestures to communicate with their caregivers. I developed this into a research idea that was awarded the Marie Skłodowska-Curie (MSCA) postdoctoral fellowship.

## Network and academic citizenship
Throughout my career thus far, I have built a **broad international and interdisciplinary network** of highly renowned scientific collaborators (Uta Noppeney and Floris de Lange, Donders Institute; Peter Hagoort, Fenna Poletiek and Judith Holler, Max Plank Institute for Psycholinguistics). I have presented my work at large international conferences (OHBM, SfN, SNL, IMRF, ECVP), and have been invited to give lectures internationally (UCL: Gabriella Vigliocco; CIMeC: Francesco Pavani, Raffaella Bernardi), where I established collaborations that are still ongoing.

I am strongly committed to **open science**, as evidenced by my ongoing contribution to an open MATLAB-based toolbox for EEG time-frequency analysis, and my sharing of research data and code in open-access repositories and publications.

I am regularly consulted as a **reviewer** in relevant journals of the field (Cerebral Cortex, JoCN, Imaging Neuroscience, Neuropsychologia) and have served as an **examiner for PhD degree congregations** (CIMeC, University of Trento, Italy; Sapienza University, Rome, Italy).

I have served as a **postdoctoral representative** at the Donders Institute, organizing scientific and social events tailored to postdocs and pushing the institute agenda towards formalizing a career training centre for postdocs.

I have extensive **supervision experience**: I have co-supervised several undergraduate and graduate students during dissertation projects and PhD projects, and I have recently been appointed two co-lectureships in my current institution.

I have been actively involved in **scientific outreach** (public engagement via interviews at Italian top-chart science podcast and YouTube; Pint of Science host).

## Transferable aspects
I am a **certified psychologist** with training in clinical neuropsychology assessment and dementia daycare at major Italian hospitals. This endows me with key interpersonal soft skills to interact with special populations and vulnerable individuals that I am directly applying in my current research activities (infant and caregiver testing).

I have practised my **communication skills in diverse settings** (academia: several talks and poster presentations at international events; outreach: podcast, YouTube, Pint of Science and InScience festivals).

I have exceptional **organizational skills**: on top of my scientific output, I have organized several corollary events (national and international symposia, journal clubs, career day for PhDs and postdocs).

My **creative and networking skills** are demonstrated by the ideation and implementation of original initiatives for scientific networking (international joint group meetings) and career development (academic skills workshop for PhDs).
