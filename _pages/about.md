I am a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoc Fellow and Teaching Assistant at CIMeC, Center for Mind/Brain Sciences, University of Trento (Italy).
I am a member of the <a href="https://r1.unitn.it/babylab/en/" target="_blank">CIMeC BabyLab</a>.

Research interests
======
From the moment we are born and first open our eyes, we are immersed in a festivity of dynamic and multisensory social stimuli: faces, voices, movements and interactions are scattered all around us. Organizing this cacophony into coherent events is crucial for our inherently social species. My research seeks to reveal **how we (learn to) make sense of our natural social world**.

* How do we combine social signals from the different senses? 
* How do we use these signals to exchange meanings with other individuals?

As a cognitive psychologist and neuroscientist, I aim to understand how **multisensory social cognition** is computed by the mind and implemented in the brain. At the societal level, I aim to remove social barriers and foster inclusivity across the lifespan by promoting new multisensory technological solutions, evidence-based education and rehabilitation.
