I am a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoc Fellow and Lecturer at CIMeC, Center for Mind/Brain Sciences, University of Trento (Italy).

Research interests
======
Language evolved, is learnt and is often used in face-to-face interactions where conversational partners exchange multimodal signals (speech, prosody, eye gaze, gestures, facial expressions etc.). I am fascinated by **how we (learn to) communicate before and beyond words**.

* How do we use verbal and non-verbal communication to exchange meanings with other individuals?
* How do we combine communicative signals from the different senses?

As a cognitive psychologist and neuroscientist, I aim to understand how **multimodal communication** is computed by the mind and implemented in the brain. At the societal level, I aim to remove communication barriers and foster inclusivity across the lifespan by promoting new multisensory technological solutions, evidence-based education and rehabilitation.
